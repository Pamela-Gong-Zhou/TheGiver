    <p><i>The Giver</i> by Lois Lowry is a story about a dystopian society where past memories are forcefully removed from people’s memories. Only an individual known as Jonas the Receiver of Memory can attain past memories and know about their stolen freedom. People are banned from ever making their own choice because the higher ups believed that people make wrong choices that would lead to problems such as war and poverty. To make people forget about their freedom, elements that encourage difference, such as colors, are all banned.</p>

    <p>This website is a reflection of the uneasiness in <i>The Giver</i>. Users will follow Jonas’ last adventure in escaping this dystopian society.
    </p>

    <p>I choose <i>The Giver</i> because I feel like the dystopian feeling of this story is becoming more of a reality. The story does not let people choose their jobs because the higher ups have already chosen their jobs for them for maximum efficiency. I think AIs are a great example of how people care more about efficiency than having intention and creativity. As such, the images I have on this website are AI generated.

      <p>The eyes symbolize the higher ups always watching people to make sure everyone’s the same and nobody strays from their ideologies.</p>
      
      <p>Although this universe is set to have no colors to make everyone the same, I still chose to have some key words or images colored to guide users through the website. Even without a traditional navigator, users should be able to move along fairly easily.</p>
      
      <p>I chose for every red link to go back to the very first page to symbolize how determined Jonas and the users must be to escape from the tyrannical world. It's easy to be pulled back.</p> 
      
      <p>Lastly, the story had an open ending that’s why the last page initially states “This is the end?”. However, the true ending is “This is The Beginning” because it is revealed Jonas has successfully left the dystopian world and started a new life in a sequel.</p>
